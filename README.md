# To-Do List in Flask and SQLite

This is a simple web application for managing a to-do list, built using
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) and
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/).

## Prerequisites

This repository builds on the concepts explained in:

- [Introduction to Flask](https://github.com/francescomari/flask-introduction)
- [To-Do List in Flask](https://github.com/francescomari/flask-todo)
- [Introduction to Databases and SQLite](https://github.com/francescomari/sqlite-todo)

The application can be set up and run using the same techniques described in the
repositories above.

## The code

Pay attention to both [the application code](app.py) and the [web application
template](templates/index.html). The application code defines all the routes
that the application responds to, while the template is responsible for
dynamically rendering the HTML of the web application depending on the to-do
list. The code that is unique to this project is heavily commented.
